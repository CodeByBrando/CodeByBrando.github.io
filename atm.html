        <h2>The ATM Program</h2>
        <p>The ATM program is one of the best electives you can choose at Bancroft Middle School. It is personally my favorite because unlike the other classes, you will use the skills you learn in this class, later in you life. So far we have learned many programs and coding which gave me the ability to make this website.</p>

        <h2>Programs I know how to navigate:</h2>
        <p>Throughout the three years that I have been in the ATM program, I have learned many programs, but of them all, I think SketchUp was my favorite. Here are some of the programs we have learned:</p>
            
            <li>Photoshop</li>
            <li>SketchUp</li>
            <li>InDesign</li>
            <li>Illustrator</li>
            <li>SketchUp</li>
