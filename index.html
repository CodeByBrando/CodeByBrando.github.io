        <p>Some facts about me are, that I live in a house with my parents, one older brother, and my dog Dusty. I have many hobbies including baseball, football, and basketball. I also like to jump on tramolines and hang out with my friends.I am in 8th grade at Bancroft Middle School in the ATM program, and after graduation, I plan to go to Millikan High School. I hope to be in the same program as my 15 year old brother, Josh. And one more fact is that I love to Skateboard.</p>
