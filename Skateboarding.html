        <h2>About my Skating Skills</h2>
            <p>Skateboarding is a very fun but sometimes difficult hobby to have in your spare time. After mastering, just riding the board the most basic tricks you should start with are the ollie and the pop shuv-it. Many of the tricks you will try will probably frustrate you because you won't easily be able to do it. But if you just be patient and practice like I did, you'll get the hang of it.</p>
